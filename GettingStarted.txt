The setup guide for stable-retro is currently only in YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPnJiUR21Og), so after watching it a few times, 
I wrote down the steps in an easy way for a dummie like me to follow.


**** Steps to get started with stable-retro on Windows ****

/*install Ubuntu 22.04 via WSL*/

* Pre-requirements
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip git zlib1g-dev libopenmpi-dev ffmpeg

* Setup virtual environment
sudo pip3 install -U virtualenv
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ~/vretro
source ~/vretro/bin/activate

* clone the repo (mine, or the original)
    ### Note that the git clone has to be done inside of the WSL machine -- Strange enough, it fails to compile
        if the repo is accessed through the windows CIFS mount inside /mnt/c

git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro.git

cd stagle-retro
pip3 install -e .

pip3 install stable_baselines3[extra]


**** Running the provided example script

* Import your legally acquired roms. Your ROMS need to match the checksum (see below).
python -m retro.import "/location/of/your/roms"

* navigate to the examples directory and start the environment
cd ~/stable-retro/retro/examples
python3 ppo.py --game='Battletoads-Nes'


**** Additional requirements to setup the Integration UI (only needed if you are interested in creating files for your own roms)

* Pre-requirements
sudo apt-get install capnproto libcapnp-dev libqt5opengl5-dev qtbase5-dev cmake

* Build steps
cmake . -DBUILD_UI=ON -UPYLIB_DIRECTORY
make -j$(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo)

* the resulting binary will be created at the location root of the repo
 ./gym-retro-integration
